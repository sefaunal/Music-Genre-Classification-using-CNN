# Music-Genre-Classification-using-CNN

#How To Use:
(You can skip the first 2 steps since the model file has already been included in this repository)
1. U need to run Dataset_Preparation.py to extract the neccesary values from the music files. But in order to do that u first need to download the GTZAN Dataset.
2. After you get your Json file from Dataset_Preparation.py u can then run CNN_Network.py to train the network and save the output model.
3. CNN_Using_PreModel.py: You can use this python file to make predictions by selecting an mp3 or wav file.
