### How To Use:
CNN_Using_PreModel.py: You can use this python file to make predictions by selecting an mp3 or wav file (Required model file has already been included in this repository).

### To Train the Network:
1. Dataset_Preparation.py: With this file you can extract the necessary features from music files. But before running this file you need to download
GTZAN dataset and edit DATASET_PATH variable to make it match your folder's path.
2. CNN_Network.py: After you get your JSON file from Dataset_Preparation.py you can use this file to train the network and export the model.
